# nan-tw fallback audio pack

This folder contains local fallback audio assets (`1.wav.txt` to `75.wav.txt`) used when the app is set to Hokkien mode.

Each file stores base64-encoded WAV data in plain text so pull requests can be created without binary-file limitations.
The web app loads and decodes these files at runtime.
